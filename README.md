# 📊 Venture Associates KPI Dashboard

**Power BI Capstone Project | Celebal Technologies Internship**

This project is a simulation of a manufacturing performance dashboard created for a fictional client, *Venture Associates INC.*, during my internship at **Celebal Technologies**. It demonstrates end-to-end Power BI capabilities including KPI tracking, data modeling, and business insights for executive stakeholders.

## 🔍 Business Objective

To build a dynamic and visually intuitive KPI dashboard for key manufacturing metrics like:
- **Cycle Processing Time (CPT)**
- **Lead Time (LVT)**
- **Non-Value-Added Time (NKT)**
- **Machine Good Time (MGT)**
- **Idle Time (IDT)**

The goal is to enable data-driven decisions to optimize production efficiency, reduce delays, and improve throughput across departments.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **KPI Matrix** with conditional formatting and status thresholds  
- 🔁 **Decomposition Tree** for drill-down analysis by department and quarter  
- 📈 **Animated Scatter Plot** (MGT vs CPT) over time for trend discovery  
- 🔮 **Forecasting Visuals** (included as value-add)  
- 📅 **Role-Based Filters** (Slicers by Year, Quarter, Department)  
- 📌 Clear performance flags for business decision-makers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Power BI** for dashboarding  
- **DAX** for custom KPIs and calculated measures  
- **Power Query (M)** for data transformation  
- **Excel/CSV** as raw input dataset

## 📈 Business Impact Simulated

- 📉 Identified idle time hotspots across quarters  
- ⚙️ Helped isolate departments with high CPT impacting overall efficiency  
- 🎯 Enhanced decision-making through scenario analysis and drill-down
